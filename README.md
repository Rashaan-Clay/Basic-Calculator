**Prerequisites:**

Before using this program, you need to have the following installed on your system:

Visual Studio Code (VSCode): A code editor that supports various programming languages, including C/C++.

C/C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C/C++ compiler set up on your system. If you haven't already installed it, follow the instructions at VSCode C/C++ Compiler Installation Guide to install the required compiler.

**How to Use:**

Clone or download the project from the repository.
  Open the project folder in VSCode.
    Ensure you have both the C/C++ compiler and VSCode extension properly installed as mentioned in the Prerequisites section.
      Open the main code file (e.g., calculator.c or calculator.cpp) in VSCode.
        Compile the code by clicking on the "Build" button or using the appropriate build command (e.g., Ctrl + Shift + B).
          Once the code is successfully compiled, run the program using the debugger.
            After running the program, you will be prompted to enter the first number.
              Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the desired operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponentiation.
                After providing the necessary inputs, the program will process the calculation and display the result.

The project is not looped, so if you wish to perform another operation, you'll need to end the program and restart it.
